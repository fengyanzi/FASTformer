- [ ] Upload the code of FAT
- [ ] Upload the dataset RSSR25
- [x] Upload the code of LAM
- [x] Upload the introduction

**Codes and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance of the paper, which I hope will be no later than March 2025.**
 
Additionally, I provide a user-friendly [LAM](https://github.com/fengyanzi/Local-Attribution-Map-for-Super-Resolution) diagnostic tool, that can be run in 2024.

The Local Attribution Map (LAM) is an interpretability tool designed for super-resolution tasks. It identifies the pixels in a low-resolution input image that have the most significant impact on the networkâ€™s output. By analyzing the local regions of the super-resolution result, LAM highlights the areas contributing the most to the reconstruction, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

Currently, I can offer some super-resolution example images.
